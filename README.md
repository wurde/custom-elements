# Custom Elements

An example of the Bit framework. https://bit.dev

Bit stands at the intersection between product and
engineering. It helps you take complex product
requirements, and break them down into independent, and
reusable pieces called "components". It allows you to
create components and compose them with each other.
Components are described by names and APIs, and contain
source code implementation. They can be of different kinds
like apps, pages, UI components, backend services and even
content. You can think of almost anything in components.
