## Consistency

A good web design is consistent across components. This isn't easy as there are many components and edge cases to consider. To enable this consistency designers need insights and guardrails on style changes.

## Prototyping

Good designers value fast iterations. Any design tool seeking the attention of these designers must act as an accelerator. They should observe productivity gains and not time sinks. Know where in the production cycle your tool fits from idea to implementation.

## Samples

Add free and premium themes. These design assets serve as a litmus test that we've created a minimum viable product. It also provides a path to earning funds to invest back into development.
