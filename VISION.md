# Theme Builder - Vision

_*Developing and communicating a long-term vision both justifies the work and guides the work._

## Consistency

The beauty behind symmetry is in it's consistency. A good web design is consistent across components. This isn't easy with many components and edge cases to consider. Empower designers with relevant insights and guardrails.

## Prototyping

Good designers value fast iterations. Any design tool seeking the attention of these designers must act as an accelerator. They should observe productivity gains and not time sinks. Know where in the production cycle your tool fits from idea to implementation.

## Samples

Reusable artifacts help bootstrap the design process. Give designers a base to build on top of. Use these design assets as the proving grounds for an minimum viable product. Provide free and premium themes with intent to reinvest funds into development.
