# Theme Builder - Vision

_*Developing and communicating a long-term vision both justifies the work and guides the work._

## Consistency

A good web design is consistent across components. This isn't easy as there are many components and edge cases to consider. To enable this consistency designers need insights and guardrails on style changes.

## Prototyping

Speed of iteration is a hallmark of a quality designer and the tooling should be built accordingly. Make design iterations fast. Give designers everything they need to take an idea and implement it. Make preview renders real-time.
